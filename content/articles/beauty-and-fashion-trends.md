The world of beauty and fashion is constantly evolving, with new trends emerging every season. However, some trends are so iconic that they continue to be missed by the internet even years after they first emerged. The 2016 beauty and fashion trends are a perfect example of this phenomenon. From bold lip colors to statement sleeves, these trends took the world by storm and continue to influence the fashion industry today.

## The Rise of Bold Lip Colors
One of the most iconic beauty trends of 2016 was the rise of bold lip colors. According to Variety, this trend was led by celebrities such as Kylie Jenner and Rihanna, who frequently rocked bright red and pink lips on the red carpet. The trend was further amplified by social media platforms such as Instagram, where users could share their own bold lip color looks and get inspiration from others. As a result, bold lip colors became a staple of 2016 beauty trends, with many makeup brands releasing their own lines of vibrant lip colors.

## Statement Sleeves and Fashion Trends
In addition to bold lip colors, 2016 was also the year of statement sleeves in fashion. As reported by Billboard, designers such as Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga featured statement sleeves in their runway shows, with models strutting down the catwalk in dresses and tops with oversized, puffy sleeves. This trend was quickly adopted by fast fashion brands, who made statement sleeves accessible to the masses. The result was a fashion landscape dominated by bold, eye-catching sleeves that added a touch of drama to any outfit.
