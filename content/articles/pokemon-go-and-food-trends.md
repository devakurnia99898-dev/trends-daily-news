The year 2016 was a pivotal moment for the gaming and food industries, with the release of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that took the world by storm. Developed by Niantic, the game allowed players to catch Pokémon in the real world, using their mobile devices to explore and interact with their surroundings. This phenomenon not only changed the way people played games but also had a significant impact on the food industry, with the rise of poke bowls and other Pokémon-inspired cuisine. According to Variety (https://variety.com), Pokémon Go was a massive success, with over 500 million downloads worldwide, and its influence can still be seen today.

## The Rise of Poke Bowls
Poke bowls, a traditional Hawaiian dish, became a viral sensation in 2016, thanks in part to the popularity of Pokémon Go. The dish, which typically consists of raw fish, rice, and vegetables, was seen as a healthy and trendy alternative to traditional fast food. Restaurants and food trucks began to capitalize on the trend, offering Pokémon-themed poke bowls and other dishes. As reported by Polygon (https://www.polygon.com), the rise of poke bowls was not only a result of the game's popularity but also a reflection of the growing demand for healthy and sustainable food options.

## Impact on the Food Industry
The influence of Pokémon Go on the food industry was not limited to poke bowls. The game's viral popularity led to a surge in demand for Pokémon-themed food and drinks, from Pokémon-shaped cookies to Pikachu-themed coffee. According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the trend was not only limited to the United States but was also seen in other countries, including Japan and South Korea. The report highlighted the creative ways in which restaurants and food establishments were using Pokémon-themed food to attract customers and create a fun and immersive experience.
