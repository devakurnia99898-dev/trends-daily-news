## 1. Review Ethics & Sample Units
To provide timely reviews, trends Daily often receives "Review Units" or early access to software from manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Google, etc.).
*   **No Pay-for-Play:** Manufacturers never pay for a review score.
*   **No Pre-Approval:** Manufacturers do not see our reviews or videos before they are published.
*   **Return Policy:** After the review period, hardware units are either returned to the manufacturer or stored in our long-term library for future comparison testing. We do not sell review units.

## 2. Affiliate Disclosure
trends Daily is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. This does not affect our editorial independence or product ratings. We list the best product for the user, regardless of commission rates.

## 3. Sourcing & Attribution
We believe in giving credit where it is due.
*   **Leaks & Rumors:** We distinguish between "Supply Chain Reports," "Trusted Insiders," and "Unverified Speculation."
*   **Attribution:** If we report on news broken by another outlet (e.g., Bloomberg, The Verge), we clearly cite and link to the original source.

## 4. Use of AI Tools
trends Daily utilizes trendsnology to assist in data aggregation. However, **human oversight is mandatory**.
*   AI tools may be used for summarizing lengthy trendsnical documents or transcribing interviews.
*   All opinions, product verdicts, and final editorial approvals are conducted by human analysts to ensure nuance and emotional intelligence.

## 5. Corrections
If we make a factual error regarding a spec sheet or trendsnical detail, we are committed to correcting it promptly with a "Correction Note" at the bottom of the article.
