In a surprising turn of events, it has been reported that former President Donald Trump has given rapper Nicki Minaj a $1 million 'Gold Card' Visa. This news has sparked a lot of interest and debate, with many questioning the validity of the claim and the potential implications of such a gesture. As a film critic and journalist, I will delve into the details of this story, exploring the possible motivations behind Trump's actions and the impact on Nicki Minaj's career.

## Background on Nicki Minaj and Trump
Nicki Minaj is a renowned rapper and singer who has been a major figure in the music industry for over a decade. She has been known for her provocative lyrics and unapologetic stage presence, which has earned her a massive following and critical acclaim. According to Billboard (https://www.billboard.com), Nicki Minaj has had numerous chart-topping hits and has collaborated with some of the biggest names in music. On the other hand, Donald Trump is a businessman and former President of the United States, who has been a polarizing figure in politics and entertainment. Trump's presidency was marked by controversy and division, and his relationship with the entertainment industry has been complex, to say the least.

## The Gold Card Visa

It is not clear why Trump would give Nicki Minaj such a gift, but it is possible that he is trying to curry favor with the rapper and her massive fan base. As reported by Vulture (https://www.vulture.com), Nicki Minaj has been a vocal supporter of Trump, and has even referred to herself as his "number one fan."
