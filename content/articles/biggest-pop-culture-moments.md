As we reflect on the year 2025, it's clear that pop culture has continued to shape and influence our society in profound ways. From the world of music and film to the realm of social media and esports, this year has seen its fair share of uplifting and degrading moments.

## The Power of Music and Film
One of the most notable trends of 2025 has been the rise of music and film as a form of social commentary.
